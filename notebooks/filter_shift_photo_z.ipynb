    "A notebook to sketch out how one could use the filter bandpass change in LSST to effectively make a narrow band survey and do very acurate photo-z on emission line galaxies\n",

    "things to do:\n",
    "1. Download 2-3 example galaxy spectra from SDSS (spiral, elliptical, star burst). Note the mag and fibermag values.\n",
    "2. Load up the canonical LSST filter (I dunno, r?), and then offset it by a small amount that is close to the expected amount.\n",
    "3. plot $g-r$ and $r_{inner}-r_{outer}$ for the galaxies as a function of redshift.\n",
    "4. Use the camera functionality on the slicer to make maps of co-added depth using just the inner and outer chips to show that the coverage and depth are pretty good.  Maybe also total exposure time and/or nvisits just to be clear that it'll be good and deep.\n",
    "5. Presumably, there is some cool cosmology to be done with all-sky BAO or something with a super accurate galaxy map in a narrow redshift slice?\n",
    "5. Point out this is an ideal level 3 data product. Make a crazy pitch that LSST could make 10A shifts in the filter set every year and do a sequence of narrow band surveys! While making an all-sky image sounds intensive, it's essentially just increasing the catalog size as if there was 1 more exposure, so it would increase the total LSST catalog by ~0.1%"
